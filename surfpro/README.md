# Predicting Surfactant Properties with SurfPro
Follow these steps to predict surfactant properties with SurfPro's GNN ensemble model:
- Move `predict_exp.py` to the `SurfPro/scripts` in the repository
- Move `surfactant_SMILES.csv` to the `SurfPro/data` in the repository
- Follow the README in SurfPro to reproduce the AttentiveFP models
- Run  `scripts/predict_exp.py`
